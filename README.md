# DSA 3rd Semester - Technical Training

This repository contains **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems** discussed in the 3rd Semester Technical Training classes conducted by **Upasana Ma'am**.  
It is designed to help **fellow students** and also serve as a personal reference to track progress and revisit concepts efficiently.

---

## Repository Highlights

- Organized **day-wise** with folders `Day1`, `Day2`, `Day3`, etc.
- Each folder contains:
  - **C++ solutions** for all discussed problems with multiple approaches
  - **notes.md** explaining the problem, approaches, time & space complexities
- Includes **optimized and brute-force solutions** side by side for better understanding
- Covers **classic DSA problems** including:
  - Array problems (Two Sum, 4Sum II, Contains Duplicate, Kth Largest)
  - Hashing and Maps (Group Anagrams, Majority Element)
- Perfect for **learning, revision, and quick reference**
